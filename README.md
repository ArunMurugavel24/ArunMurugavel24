# P. M. Arun

In May 2020,after working more than 20 years in the animal care field, I began my journey into the field of web development and design. My previous work experiences have honed my problem solving and written/verbal communication abilities. I can effectively self-manage during independent projects and also enjoy collaborating in a team setting. I am a highly-motivated, self-sufficient fast learner with a strong work ethic and have been working diligently this past year to learn front-end web development and design!
